       You can skip the installation of dependencies by adding space-separated values to one or  more  of  the  following  environment
       variables: [1m$HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_BREW_SKIP[22m, [1m$HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_CASK_SKIP[22m, [1m$HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_MAS_SKIP[22m, [1m$HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_TAP_SKIP[22m.

              Uninstall all dependencies not present in the [1mBrewfile[22m.

       This workflow is useful for maintainers or testers who regularly install lots of formulae.

       Unless [1m--force [22mis passed, this returns a 1 exit code if anything would be removed.

       [1mbrew bundle check[0m
              Check if all dependencies present in the [1mBrewfile [22mare installed.

       This provides a successful exit code if everything is up-to-date, making it useful for scripting.

       [1mbrew bundle list[0m
              List all dependencies present in the [1mBrewfile[22m.

       By default, only Homebrew formula dependencies are listed.

       [1mbrew bundle exec [22m[[1m--check[22m] [4mcommand[0m
              Run an external command in an isolated build environment based on the [1mBrewfile [22mdependencies.

       This  sanitized  build  environment  ignores  unrequested dependencies, which makes sure that things you didn’t specify in your
       [1mBrewfile [22mwon’t get picked up by commands like [1mbundle install[22m, [1mnpm install[22m, etc. It will also add compiler flags which will help
